    <content type="text"><![CDATA[What Is the InternetA Nuts-and-Bolts DescriptionThe Internet is a computer network that interconnects billions of computing devices throughout the world. All of these devices are called hosts or end systems. End systems are connected together by a network of communication links and packet switches. Transmission rate is measured in bits/second. When one end system has data to send to another end system, the sending end system segments the data and adds header bytes to each segment. The resulting packages of information is known as packets. The two most prominent types in today’s Internet are routers and link-layer switches. The sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet from the sending end system to the receiving end system is known as a route or path through the network. End systems access the Internet through Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Protocols control the sending and receiving of information within the Internet. The Transmission Control Protocol(TCP) and the Internet Control Protocol(TCP) are two of the most important protocols in the Internet. Internet standards are developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF). The IETF standards documents are called request for comments(RFCs). A Services DescriptionThe applications that Internet provides services to are said to be distributed applications, since they involve multiple end systems that exchange data with each other. Socket interface specifies how a program running on one end system asks the Internet infrastructure to deliver data to a specific destination program running on another end system. What Is a Protocol?A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event. The Network EdgeHosts are sometimes further divided into two categories: clients and servers. Access Networks The access network is the network that physically connects and end system to the first router(also known as the “edge router”). Home AccessToday, the two most prevalent types of broadband residential access are digital subscriber line(DSL) and cable. For the DSL Internet access, the residential telephone line carries both data and traditional telephone signals simultaneously, which are encoded at different frequencies: A high-speed downstream channel, in the 50 kHz to 1MHz band A medium-speed upstream channel, in the 4 kHz to 50 kHz band An ordinary two-way telephone channel, in the 0 to 4 kHz band The DSL standards define multiple transmission rates, including 55 Mbps downstream and 15 Mbps upstream[ITU 2006]. The access is said to be asymmetric. While DSL makes use of telco’s existing local telephone infrastructure, cable Internet access makes use of the cable television company’s existing cable television infrastructure. The cable Internet access is typically asymmetric, with downstream channel typically allocated a higher transmission rate than the upstream channel. The DOCSIS 2.0 standard defines downstream rates up to 42.8 Mbps and upstream rates of up to 30.7 Mbps. An up-and-coming technology that provides even higher speeds is fiber to the home(FTTH). The FTTP concept is simple–provide an optical fiber path from the CO directly to the home. This image shows FTTH using the passive optical network(PON) distribution architecture. Each home has an optical network terminator(ONT), which is connected by dedicated optical fiber to a neighborhood splitter. The splitter combines a number of homes onto a single, shared optical fiber, which connects to an optical line terminator(OLT) in the telco’s CO. The OLT, providing conversion between optical and electrical signals, connects to the Internet via a teleco router. In locations where DSL, cable, and FTTH are not available, a satellite link can be used to connect a residence to the Internet at speeds of more than 1 Mbps. Dial-up access over traditional phone lines is based on the same model as DSL–a home modem connects over a phone line to a modem in the ISP. Dial-up access is excruciatingly slow at 56 kbps. Access in the Enterprise (and the Home): Ethernet and WiFi On corporate and university campuses, and increasingly in home settings, a local area networ(LAN) is used to connect an end system to the edge router. Ethernet is by far the most prevalent access technology in many types of LAN technologies. With Ethernet access, users typically have 100 Mbps or 1Gbps access to the Ethernet switch, whereas servers may have 1 Gbps or even 10 Gbps access. Wireless LAN access based on IEEE 802.11 technology, more colloquially known as WiFi, is now everywhere. 802.11 today provides a shared transmission rate of up to more than 100 Mbps. Wide-Area Wireless Access: 3G and LTEDevices like smartphones employ the same wireless infrastructure used for cellular telephony to send/receive packets through a base station that is operated by the cellular network provider. Physical MediaFor each transmitter-receiver pair, a bit is sent by propagating electromagnetic waves or optical pulses across a physical medium. Physical medium fall into two categories: guided media and unguided media. With guided media, the waves are guided along a solid medium, such as a fiber-optic cable, a twisted-pair copper wire, or a coaxial cable. With unguided media, the waves propagate in the atmosphere and in outer space, such as in a wireless LAN or a digital satellite channel. Twisted-Pair Copper WireThe least expensive and most commonly used guided transmission medium. Unshielded twisted pair(UTP) is commonly used for computer networks within a building, that is, for LANs. Data rates for LANs using twisted pair today range from 10 Mbps to 10 Gbps, which depend on the thickness of the wire and the distance between transmitter and receiver. Coaxial CableLike twisted pair coaxial cable consists of two copper conductors, but the two conductors are concentric rather than parallel, which can make coaxial cable achieve high data transmission rates. Coaxial cable can be used as a guided shared medium. Fiber OpticsAn optical fiber is a thin, flexible medium that conducts pulses of light, with each pulse representing a bit. A single optical fiber can support tremendous bit rates, up to tens of even hundreds of gigabits per second. They are immune to electromagnetic interference. Terrestrial Radio ChannelsThey require no physical wire to be installed. Satellite Radio ChannelsThe communication satellite receives transmissions on one frequency band, regenerates the signal using a repeater, and transmits the signal on another frequency. The Network Core Packet SwitchingIn a network application, end systems exchange messages with each other.To send message from a source end system to a destination end system, the source breaks long messages into smaller chunks of data known as packets. Between source and destination, each packet travels through communication links and packet switches(two predominant types, routers and link-layer switches). Store-and-Forward TransmissionMost packet switches use store-and-forward transmission at the inputs to the links. It means that the packet switch must receive the entire packet before it can begin to transmit the first bit of the packet onto the outbound link. Queuing Delays and Packet LossEach packet switch has multiple links attached to it. For each attached link, the packet switch has an output buffer(also called an output queue), which stores packets that the router is about to send into the link. Due to this, packets suffer output buffer queuing delays. When an arriving packet find that the buffer is completely full with other packets waiting for transmission, packet loss will occur–either the arriving packet or one of the already-queued packets will be dropped. Forwarding Tables and Routing ProtocolsIn the Internet, every end system has an address called an IP address. A packet source includes the destination’s IP address in the packet’s header. Each router has a forwarding table that maps destination addresses(or portions of the destination addresses) to that router’s outbound links. The Internet has a number of special routing protocols that are used to automatically set the forwarding tables. A routing protocol may, for example, determine the shortest path from each router to each destination and use the shortest path results to configure the forwarding tables in the routers. Circuit SwitchingThere are two fundamental approaches to moving data through a network of links and switches: circuit switching and packet switching. In circuit-switched networks, the resources(buffers, link transmission rate) needed along a path to provide for communication between the end systems are reserved for the duration of the communication session between the end systems. In packet-switched networks, these resources are not reserved. Consider the traditional telephone networks, the network must establish a connection between the sender and the receiver. The switches on the path between the sender and receiver maintain connection state for that connection. This connection is called a circuit. Multiplexing in Circuit-Switched NetworksA circuit in a link is implemented with either frequency-division multiplexing(FDM) or time-division multiplexing(TDM). With FDM, the frequency spectrum of a link is divided up among the connections established across the link. The link dedicates a frequency band to each connection for the duration of the connection. The width of the band is called bandwidth. For a TDM link, time is divided into frames of fixed duration, and each frame is divided into a fixed number of time slots. These slots are dedicated for the sole use of that connection. Packet Switching Versus Circuit SwitchingPacket switching has end-to-end delays is variable and unpredictable.(due primarily to variable and unpredictable queuing delays) But it offers better sharing of transmission capacity than circuit switching and it is simpler, more efficient, and less costly to implement than circuit switching. Circuit switching pre-allocates use of the transmission link regardless of demand, with allocated but unneeded link time going unused. Packet switching on the other hand allocates link use on demand.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[在期末考试之前的那段日子里得知字节跳动要和学校联合搞一个Android的暑期课程, 本着闲着也是闲着的心态填了报名表. 训练从7月11号开始, 一直持续到8月22号. 对于我而言, Android是一个全新的东西, 所以说学起来并不是那么轻松. 两个星期的速成课每天都要接收大量的信息, 每天课后还有相应的实验需要完成. 尽管有点累, 总的来说还是很充实, 最后也顺利地和家祺完成了大作业的答辩. 而现在已经是八月的第二天了, 昨天去参加了字节跳动的Android实习的面试. 结果挺惨淡, 被面试官问得心里发毛. 回来后的感觉说不上来是失落还是什么, 毕竟本来也确实是抱着不管怎样去面一下总不亏的想法, 不过确实感觉心里梗梗的, 准确来说就是焦虑吧. 为什么会有这样的焦虑呢, 可能是因为理想与现实之间的巨大落差, 更可怕的是造成这种落差的根源就是自己. 回望这两年的大学生活, 除去那么几个时间点略微地为自己考虑和规划, 更多的是被推着迷茫地向前走. 对于专业课程, 大多只是流于表面, 而没有去深究. 现在想起来, 好像大学以来就没有细致地, 完整地读过任何一本书, 大多是人云亦云, 跟风从众, 三分热度, 半途而废. 老实说, 我是一个在自我管理方面做得很差的一个人, 特别是当没有一个明确的目标时, 往往会把大量的时间浪费在无意义的社交网络上, 窥探别人的生活, 荒废自己的日子. 现在是大二结束的暑假, 好像是时候为自己未来的人生做做规划了. Android是一个有趣的东西, 在开发Android的过程中, 既能体验到前端设计的美, 又能和后端通信满足一点点控制欲. 总听到种一棵树, 最好的时机是十年前, 其次是现在. 为了在这个学期结束后的寒假找到一份满意的实习, 大概需要掌握数据结构与算法, 数据库, 操作系统, 汇编语言, 计算机网络, Android开发, Java特性等等的技能. 接下来的日子里就在这个博客里记录我的计划和学习吧.]]></content>
